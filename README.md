Abstract : 
This paper deals with the prediction of the total claim amount of a drought episode
under the French ”Catastrophe Naturelle” regime. Due to the specificity of this regime, a quick
prediction of the final amount of an incident is particularly strategic. The approach that we
use is based on a database constituted by the French Federation of Insurers in order to cover
approximately 70% of the French market. Linking it with meteorological data and socioeconomic
data allows one to increase our vision of the exposure. Although the database is large, with a
wide vision of the French metropolitan territory, data is imbalanced since a large majority of
cities are not stroke by catastrophic events. Machine learning methods are used to compute a
prediction.
